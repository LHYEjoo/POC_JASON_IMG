# Interview with Jason

## We would first like to paint a personal picture of how someone gets involved in something like this.

### Question: What was your life like before your activism?

Jason: Before I became involved in the social movement, my life was much like that of most people. I worked hard every day, hoping to retire early. Outside of work, I spent most of my time hiking, shopping, and watching movies with my family. Life was peaceful and stable.

### Question: What made you engage in activism? Was there a specific moment?

Jason: In the past, I didn’t truly pay attention to social issues. Although I always voted in elections and occasionally joined rallies or marches, I had taken part in fewer than ten street demonstrations before turning thirty. It wasn’t until I was thirty-one that [was when] everything changed, when I saw the government using violence to disperse peaceful citizens who were simply expressing their opinions. I felt an overwhelming sense of anger, and from that day on, I began to take part in street protests. What started as occasional participation after work eventually led me to become an organizer within the movement.

### Question: What did you think of people who did not join the protest?

Jason: At different points in time, my perspective has evolved. In the beginning, I cared a lot about how many people showed up at protests, and whether others shared the same views as I did. Back then, I often felt angry, even resentful, toward those who seemed indifferent to social issues or who held different opinions. 

But after ten years of experience, I’ve come to understand that in a democratic system, diversity of thought is inevitable. There will always be people who participate actively, and others who remain on the sidelines, what we might call “democratic free riders.” Now, when I see people who choose not to care or take part, I mostly feel a sense of pity for them, because they’re giving up their own rights. But I no longer feel anger. 

Later, I realized that I myself used to be a “democratic free rider.” I enjoyed the benefits of freedom of speech and the rule of law without truly understanding that these rights were earned through the struggles of countless people before me. Because I was once like that too, I’ve come to understand that anger alone doesn’t change people, only education and dialogue can inspire more of them to stand up.

### Question: What was it like to join your first protest?

Jason: The first time I took to the streets to join a protest, I witnessed the deep-rooted injustice and inequality within our society. It was then that I truly realized how much my home had already fallen apart. That realization made me want to do something, to contribute whatever I could to help change, or even begin to reverse, these problems, no matter how small my effort might be.

### Question: During the protests, did you use any violence? Did you destroy anything?

Jason: We tried many peaceful ways to express our demands. When we peacefully demonstrated on the streets, the government sent law enforcement officers who violently dispersed us. When we entered the legislature through elections hoping to change society from within the system, they abused administrative powers to strip our representatives of their mandates. By the time of the 2019 protests, the regime had colluded with criminal elements and tolerated attacks by pro-government groups on citizens who were peacefully creating Lennon Walls or speaking at street booths. When normal channels could no longer protect us, we were forced to resist.

As pro-government forces became willing to use violence against us, the government deployed better-equipped units that employed tactics clearly beyond standard policing guidelines, and those who violated the law were rarely held accountable. As a result, we escalated our tactics with the aim of increasing the cost to businesses connected to the regime or triad-linked interests, so they would bear responsibility for harming the people. All the sites we targeted were related to Chinese-capital interests; we did not intend to harm innocent people. Facing law enforcement, our frontline initially used umbrellas to form barricades to prevent them from disrupting our activities and carrying out arrests.

When those measures proved insufficient to keep people safe, we began using petrol bombs and other means, shifting from merely blocking to actively fighting back, because we felt this regime no longer served the people but rather served the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Our goal was to overturn that government and rebuild an electoral system that truly serves the public, so that officials who govern are accountable to the people. I believe most Hongkongers, myself included, never chose violence as a first option; it was a defensive response born of necessity, not hatred or a desire to destroy.

During the protests, I was involved in clashes with triad-linked groups and I used petrol bombs against government-deployed units. I no longer like to call them “law enforcers”, law should be fair and impartial, but the law as it stood clearly favored the powerful. I never took part in smashing shops or harming innocent people; my focus was on protecting those at the scene, on self-defense and shielding others, while making demands was secondary. From my perspective, what we used was force; the real violence came from the regime that abused its power and used force against citizens.

### Question: Didn’t you fear to be prosecuted because of the violence being used at the protest?

Jason: Of course we did not want to be arrested, but we understood that changing society comes at a cost. At the time, many of us were mentally prepared to pay a ten-year price（because the maximum sentence for rioting was ten years.）Later we realized that ten years was far too short; the reality is that this could be a lifelong price to pay. Even so, I do not regret my decision, because it was the sacrifice I was willing to make for the health and freedom of our society.

### Question: Why did you choose to participate in violent protests?

Jason: We had already tried every possible peaceful means of expression, some protesters even resorted to self-sacrifice to make their voices heard. Yet those in power remained indifferent and refused to address our core demands: genuine universal suffrage with one person, one vote; the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry; accountability for police abuse of power; and responsibility for officials who failed in governance. When all peaceful methods were ignored, the resort to force became an inevitable outcome.

### Question: Do you disavow or approve the use of violence? Why?

Jason: If peaceful means are still effective, one should never resort to force. In violent confrontations, the loss of life and the injuries sustained, both physical and psychological, leave wounds that can never truly heal. At the same time, we should not demonize armed resistance. History has shown time and again that when a regime becomes deeply unjust and leaves people with no way out, resistance through force inevitably arises.

### Question: How did the protests of 2014 and 2019 differ for you personally?

Jason: During the 2014 Umbrella Movement, many of the activities were led by civic organizations, and political figures still held strong influence. As someone from a smaller, less-heard group at the time, I often felt that our voices were drowned out by the supporters of these political celebrities. That made me realize that, although it was called a “citizen movement,” it wasn’t truly led by citizens. By 2019, however, most people had abandoned the idea of following organizations and began to organize actions spontaneously. Except for acts that clearly violated moral principles, almost every different idea and approach was treated fairly. We often said at the time, “Regardless of political stance, as long as you oppose authoritarianism, you are an ally.” It was this spirit of unity and autonomy that forced the Chinese government to break its own promises and impose the Hong Kong National Security Law. 

To me, a genuine citizen movement is one that is led by the people themselves,  inclusive, diverse, and where politicians play only a supporting role.

###Question: Why did you decide to leave after the 2019 protest instead of after the 2014 protest?

We chose to leave because after the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law, it became clear that even imprisonment would not make Hong Kong better. Many things could no longer be done there, and many things could no longer be said. So we decided to go abroad to continue the struggle and keep speaking out, hoping that, in a safer environment, we could keep working for Hong Kong’s future.

### Question: Why were you and your friends prosecuted?

Jason: We were all prosecuted under different charges simply because we stood against authoritarianism and sought to defend Hong Kong’s democracy, freedom, and the rule of law.

### Question: Why did you flee after the intimidation? 

Jason: I don’t see myself as [someone who was] running away,  I simply changed the ground on which I continue to fight. Honestly, knowing how deeply the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has infiltrated organized crime groups in Taiwan, I realize that what I face now is not just the risk of imprisonment, but a threat to my personal safety.

### Question: What exactly were you afraid of?

Jason: I didn’t leave out of fear, I left because I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to be arbitrarily arrested or put on trial again. I didn’t want to live under constant surveillance or be silenced. Most importantly, I didn’t want to give up while there were still ways to contribute to Hong Kong’s cause.

### Question: Were you or your friends asked to become police/secret service informants? Did you still trust your friends after the arrests?

Jason: I was only asked to provide information, while my friend was pressured to work for them. That experience of being arrested did not shake my trust in genuine protesters, what matters is whether a person is truly selfless and committed to justice. As long as they are, I will trust them. 

### Question: How did you flee to Taiwan? Was it difficult to organize? Did you have to be secretive about it or is it as simple as booking a plane ticket and leaving?

Jason: When I left, I did receive assistance from an organization in Taiwan, but the details must remain confidential. All I can say is that it wasn’t as simple as just buying a plane ticket and leaving. 

### Question: Your story reminds us of the repression of activists in the UK and the Netherlands:  for example the UK’s 5 year prison sentences for climate protest organizers, the 1000s of citizens who are being prosecuted as terrorists for opposing the Gaza genocide, in the Netherlands many activists get harassed by the police with surprise visits in their homes and many people who have been approached by the security services to become informants. Because of this, I am trying to understand 
a.	How is repression of activists in HongKong different compared to the West?
b.	Do you think that neither of us live in true freedom & democracy because of the way activists are treated by the government?
c.	What would living in freedom & democracy mean to you?


Jason: I believe that many parts of the world still do not truly have freedom or democracy. When a government fears the voices of its citizens and uses laws or violence to silence dissent, that kind of freedom is only superficial. To me, freedom and democracy are not just about the right to vote or to speak, they mean that people can genuinely take part in decision-making, can criticize those in power, and can do so without fear of retaliation. 

They also mean a society that embraces diversity, where people with different views can still respect one another. True freedom is when speaking the truth doesn’t cost you everything; true democracy is when power truly belongs to the people, not just to those in government. At the same time, I believe that freedom does not mean the absence of boundaries. Real freedom must be grounded in truth, morality, and integrity. If someone uses freedom and democracy to spread falsehoods or to harm others, then they are, in fact, using freedom and democracy to destroy them. 

### Question: Do you have any closing remarks you’d like to share with a wider audience? 
Jason:I hope the world will not forget Hong Kong. And I hope that everyone who still lives in a free society will cherish the rights you have, because what we lost is exactly what you now possess. Freedom is never born by itself; it must be protected by courage, generation after generation. Wherever you are, as long as you speak for justice and stand with the oppressed, you are part of freedom itself. I still believe that as long as our spirit remains unbroken, the soul of Hong Kong will never be destroyed.
