Jason’s oldest dog is 13 years old, it is the big brother.  

 

There’s a spot in Taiwan that Jason and Emily like to visit. There is an old couple that come there every day to dance. The old couple really moves Jason. Seeing their harmony brings tears to his eyes. They're absolutely sweet and adorable. 

 

Every day, Jason and Emily practice sparring together. That’s a different kind of ‘dancing.’

# Jason tells how intimidation by the Hong Kong made him and his wife leave Hong Kong  

 

 

After news of my lawsuit became public, I noticed many suspicious people 

near my workplace and home. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 

there were few Chinese tourists in HK, but we noticed many Chinese men, 

clearly not from HK, watching us downstairs. Every day we took our dogs to work. After work, we would walk the dogs before heading home. To the right of our office was a dog park where we walked them, and to the left was the direction of our home. One day, after walking the dogs in the park, we turned left to go home, and I saw two men watching us. After staring at us for about 10 seconds, they awkwardly pulled out phones, pretending to look for directions. We ignored them, and crossed the street. But when we turned around, they were still watching us. We think they were from 

National Security.They were obviously not Hongkongers (HKers).They might think I had connections with some organizations or people behind me. 

I think they had two reasons to follow me. The first reason was to gather information and see who we were connected to.The second reason was to make sure we saw them and make us leave HK. They made us feel unsafe. What I did wasn't actually in violation of any law. I participated in protests or demonstrations, yes, but those activities are allowed under the Basic Law. In that situation, National Security 

didn't like people like us. If they detained me again, it would be a disgrace for them. So they let us see them to let us know we were being watched. 

 

They believed, if we felt unsafe, we would leave; otherwise, they would detain us. That was the situation at the time. So they let us see them, and we decided to leave voluntarily. For them, it was less trouble. But it was a very sad thing to leave our own homeland voluntarily. In fact, we even considered that, even if we were detained for a few years by them again, we would be willing to stay in HK if HK had a positive change afterward. However, we felt that HK wouldn’t change in the next decade. 

 

So we decided to leave for another place, where we wouldn't be detained. We could also help HKers from outside. We thought that would be more valuable. 

 

# Jason tells about his arrest and his case 

 

47 of my friends were detained on the same day, including my wife. 

After we were detained, we were charged with rioting. 

As we were detained at different times that day, we were divided into three separate cases. I was the first defendant in the first case. My case was the first to involve a large-scale "riot" and mass arrests. So, my case would impact the subsequent cases. I was the defendant in the first case of this kind. Because of such background of my case, after we were charged with rioting but acquitted. The HK's Department of Justice focused on a specific ruling in my case, and sought to expand the scope of prosecution. So, instead of appealing the entire case, they appealed a specific element within it, the Joint Enterprise principle. When their appeal reached the High Court, the HK government won the appeal, which I found deeply unjust. So I appealed their appeal, eventually bringing the case to the Court of Final Appeal. After this case was reported by the media, we began to be monitored. 

 

# Jason tells why they chose to move to Taiwan, and not somewhere else.  

 

When we were considering our options, we had two choices. 

One option was to go to Canada with Emily, as she is Canadian. However, we felt that our struggle wasn't over. We've been here in Taiwan for over three years. The repression and surveillance from HK government haven't ceased. We feel that, together with the Taiwanese,we share and endure the same repression from the same authoritarian regime. Here, our experiences and ideas could help contribute to 

Taiwan's efforts in resisting this authoritarian regime. That's why we chose to move to Taiwan. 

 

# Jason tells how he and Emily help people in Taiwan.  

 

We focus on sharing the stories of HK and ourselves. My personal experience helps them see how the HK government violates its promises to HKers, such as One Country Two Systems, the Basic Law, and Sino-British Joint Declaration. They (the HK government) broke their promises, and I am one of the victims. When I tell my story, Taiwanese gradually learn more about what happened in HK, because I've realized that, while many Taiwanese followed the HK's anti-extradition protests, they didn't fully understand what was going on. So, I share the stories of HK and our experiences, with the Taiwanese. We also organize activities to amplify the voices of HKers who are also being repressed. Through these efforts, we hope to inspire Taiwanese to safeguard their freedom. 

 

 

# Jason tells what happened to him during the Umbrella Revolution  

 

At the time of the umbrella revolution, me and Emily were two of the people who went to Mong Kok.  

 

On July 28, when they started firing tear gas, I was at the gym training. Around 6 p.m.,some friends told me that tear gas was being used outside. My sparring partner and I stepped out with some water, to check things out. By the evening, I saw that the crowd was still there, so I went to see if there was anything I could do to help.The next day, some suggested that we shouldn't just occupy HK's Central, but also expand to Tsim Sha Tsui, Causeway Bay, and Mong Kok. I've always loved Mong Kok—I used to go there a lot as a kid—so I went there. That day, if the Umbrella Revolution hadn't happened, I had originally planned to ask Emily out on a date. But since the Umbrella Revolution happened, our "date" ended up in Mong Kok. That was actually our first date. It was not exactly love at first sight. We already knew each other, but that was our first date. Originally, it was just a date, but the Umbrella Revolution suddenly happened. 

 

### Jason talks about how he feels about protesting and the hardships with it on an emotional level, and how it has ever since then changed his life. And also how he feels sorry for the younger generation 

I guess you can say that I am someone who enjoys fighting for a cause and voicing my opinion. Protests and demonstrations gave me some stress, but not exactly the trouble you might think of. I actually feel that my generation has brought a lot of trouble to HKers, so it’s a different kind of trouble. In the 1960's to 1980's, discussions about HK's future began if my generation had been more aware and engaged in our society. Maybe, just maybe the Anti-extradition and umbrella revolution could have been prevented and wouldn't have happened at all. 

 

I still think that we didn't do enough back then, and as a result many young HK’ers born after the 1990s were affected by that lack of engagement of the previous generation. But back then, I was just a normal, ordinary person and the major changes in our lives after protesting have brought a lot of stress to both me and my wife. 

 

 

Even now, when I'm living in Taiwan, im still not skilled at doing these [activism] activities. But we have to keep protesting to keep our voices heard and to inform people about the situation in HK. So many people are already too scared to do it. After we were detained by the police for protesting our photo's were exposed in the media. You could find us anywhere. So for us there was no more place left to hide. This resulted in us not being able to live the normal live we had before the protest, the only way if forward. So me and my wife Emily decided to push through and move forward. 

 

# Question: Since you've already left your homeland, are you worried something like this might happen again? 
 
### Here Jason talks about feelings of moving away from Taiwan and how he thinks about the unification of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and HK. And shows his dissatisfaction with the PRC in the Treaty of Nanking, talks about technicallities in the treaty and how Taiwan should be the rightfull heir. 

 

 

Jason:  
Yes we are worried every single day. Even though we are in Taiwan and are still waiting to become permanent residents, we already feel like Taiwan is our (new) homeland. We have already lost our home in Hong Kong. The thought of losing our home in Taiwan and having to move away again to another country is what worries us the most. 

Some people say that the unification of the PRC and HK is natural and will eventually happen. This is because it was separated from the PRC to become a colony [of the UK] for 100 years. But if you think about it, in light of true history, the PRC was never technically HK's rightful owner, Taiwan actually was. This is because when the Treaty of Nanking was signed, which was on August 29, 1892. Which essentially ended the first opium war between China and the Great Brittian. And give Hong Kong island to the UK in the process. This treaty was signed during the Qing Empire. The Republic of China (ROC, better known as Taiwan) was established before the People's Republic of China (PRC, Mainland China today).  

 

So if you consider the treaty of Nanking, and talk about the rightful owner of HK. It should be Taiwan whom is the legitimate owner of HK. If we are discussing who holds the true Chinese heritage, then Taiwan is the rightful heir. The PRC has existed since 1949, about 75 years, while the ROC has been around since 1912, almost 115 years. So how would the ‘parent’ (PRC) be younger than its ‘child’ (ROC). It just doesnt make sense. 

 

So if the PRC claims to be the suzerain of HK, how do we explain the whole existence of the ROC? In that case, the claim of the PRC just doesn't stand. And the Treaty of Nanking isn't even in the PRC, its in Taiwan, at the Taipei Palace Museum.  

But there have been a lot of political maneuverings back then, such as the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The PRC was recongized as the rightful owner of HK because of political maneuverings in the 70's and 80's, rather than something that should've happened according to true history. 

 

So in my generation, the UK was our colonial ruler, and technically Taiwan should've been the one to rightfully suzerain to reclaim HK. Maybe if the political environment had been better at the time. It would've been Taiwan who would've negotiated HK's future instead of the PRC. Moreover, HK had no say in the negotiations; everything was dictated by PRC, which never bothered to ask HK what we wanted. Back then, the PRC also co-opted many HK's scholars and elites. To promote the whole narritive of “National reunification". That was the beginning of all the lies that the PRC's have, which later culminated. In signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, One Country Two Systems, and the Basic Law. The Basic Law was supposed to 

grant us HK’ers the right to vote, but later the PRC dismissed all these promises as historical documents. So, the PRC is nothing but a liar! 

 

From reclaiming HK to its governance afterward, the PRC has been deceitful 

every step of the way! 

 

# Question: You mentioned earlier that you are worried about the possibility of "unification" happening here someday. Do you feel safe in Taiwan? 
 
### Jason talks about his sense of safety being low, how people form the PRC won't cherish freedom and democracy and how they undermine those of others and how it can be used as a cognitive method to ‘brainwash’ the Taiwanese. 

 

Honestly, our sense of safety here is quite low. The only safety we feel comes from the fact that we can freely express our own opinions here without being arrested or prosecuted for our opinions. It only reaches this extent. But when it comes to physical safety, I don’t think Taiwan is in a truly secure state. Because the source of 

the repression doesn't just come from the PRC government but also from ideas and 

narratives the PRC is spreading. 

 

Although there are good people in PRC, most of them have grown up in an environment devoid of freedom. In the 75 years since the founding of the PRC, those people under 70 have never lived in a free society or experienced democratic values, and they have no understanding of the value of freedom and democracy. 

 

So, they won't cherish freedom and democracy either. Even when they come to places that enjoy freedom and democracy, they don't cherish it. From their young age, they've been taught messages like "You have no freedom" and "Freedom and democracy are bad", etc. So, when they travel abroad, some even undermine the freedoms of others, for example, just the other day, a Chinese tourist disrupted free speech here in Taiwan. 

 

This is what worries me the most, as Taiwan hasn't taken strong measures to prevent people like that from coming here, those who undermine democracy and freedom. For instance, a few days ago, a Chinese official-affiliated celebrity, Andy Lau, came here and performed a song called ‘I Am Chinese’. In stark contrast, 

during our protests in HK, we had a song called ‘Glory to Hong Kong’; However, we couldn't sing it in HK or in the PRC, anyone who did was arrested and prosecuted. 

 

There was even an older man who played Glory to Hong Kong 

on a cello, he didn't even sing it, just played it, and he was sentenced to 

two months in prison. So, when we HKers can't even play an instrumental version of our song, why are PRC officials allowed to come here and sing I Am Chinese? 

 

What is the PRC so afraid of? Because Taiwan isn't afraid, and that's what worries us the most. Taiwan's government believes in its freedom and believes that Taiwanese people understand the value of it. 

 

So, Taiwan let's anyone come here, speak, sing, and do whatever they want,as long as it doesn't harm the dignity of the the Taiwanese. But that freedom is the very space that the CCP exploits to undermine democracy. This is exactly what happened in HK. I saw this kind of infiltration through movies and media, as I grew up. Elements like "I am Chinese", "China should rise/grow strong" were embedded in films and songs that I consumed as a kid. So, by the time I grew up in the 1990s, 

I didn't see China as a problem, because this cultural infiltration made me feel like "I'm Chinese too" or "China seems fine, not a big issue". 

 

But by the 2000s, the cracks began to show. In 2003, the PRC government pushed for HK's Article 23 legislation, which was a first clear warning that the PRC wouldn't allow HK to be a democratic society. By 2014, the PRC's lies were fully exposed, igniting the events that followed. Here in Taiwan, when I see Andy Lau performing, it reminds me of HK in the 1980s. During that time, the CCP used similar brainwashing tactics,now CCP is doing the same to the Taiwanese to undermine our cognitive defence. If CCP is given another 10 or 20 years, Taiwanese might really think "Maybe unification with PRC isn't so bad". 
 
# Question: Could Taiwanese accept unification?  

 
Yes, and if that happens, people like us [activists] would be in serious trouble. It's certainly a possibility, and I fear it's becoming dangerously likely.  

 

You think so too [Emily]? 

 

Emily: Yes. Most Taiwanese are comfortable with the current situation, and their awareness of threats from across the strait is relatively low. So, if this mindset persists, unification could possibly happen.  
 
# Question: Who worries the most between the two of you? 

 
### Jason and Emily talk about who worries the most about their current situation in Taiwan and possible future developments from the situation and how they support each other. 

 

Jason: Our worries are about the same.  
Emily: He probably worries more. 

 

Question: You think he worries more? Why? 

 

Emily: Because sometimes I have to take care of our 4 dogs and handle other things, I don't spend as much time thinking and worrying about the issues as he does. But he has to deal with many assemblies, research various NGOs, and advocate for different causes. He spends more time on these matters, so naturally, he thinks and worries more. When he does think about the issues, it’s usually more negative, sometimes.  
 
Question: And how do you support him? What do you say to him? 

 

Emily: He's usually more positive when talking to others, but sometimes, deep down, his thoughts are a bit negative regarding these issues.He knows I understand him, so I don't say much, but stay by his side. Walk the dog together, and try to live a more normal life. 
 
Question: You mentioned that unification might already be approaching? 

 

Jason: Yes, it's getting very close to the point where the CCP's infiltration might bring both sides of the Taiwan Strait to accept "unification". It's very close to that point. So, the current polls still show a little gap. One poll in Taiwan investigated how many Taiwanese consider themselves Chinese. In fact, over 80% of people in Taiwan identify themselves as Taiwanese. But if those Taiwanese believe in the "One Country Two Systems" in HK, i.e. "People in the PRC and Taiwan are both Chinese and can coexist", then if the poll investigates that belief, I think the poll result could be the opposite.  
 
# Question: Have you made any plans? [regarding the future] 

 

We don't have big plans. We're just continuing to live here. Our plan is 

to stay here and not leave, unlike what happened to us in HK. We won't leave again. We definitly do not want to go through the whole experience again. It was too painful. Leaving HK was heartbreaking. Now that we're in Taiwan, we don't want to go through that again. Never again. Whatever the outcome, we'll face it. This is the decision we made after careful discussion. 

 

Having left once already, it was very hard emotionally. Since we chose Taiwan, we'll do our best to protect it. This is our second homeland.  
 
 
# Question: Speaking of HK, what do you miss the most? 

 

What I miss the most are my friends in HK and the area where I grew up. Since HK is so small, I mostly lived in one area while I was there. I still remember the layout of its streets, and miss the food there, just these little things. Sometimes when I see similar places in Taiwan, it reminds me of HK, and I start to miss life there. I dont often dream about HK but when I do, the dreams are usually vivid, and are mostly about things that happened when I was a child there. It is not easy. 

Living in another place is not easy. 

 

What's most heartbreaking is that neither of us can go back to HK. 

Some of our friends who have come to Taiwan can go back to HK during their vacations, to enjoy foods or visit friends; but we can't go back to HK. We can only visit our friends when they come to Taiwan. But the feeling is very different, seeing HK friends in HK and seeing them in TW bring completely different emotions. 

 

 

The most innocent are our dogs. But what's better in Taiwan than in HK is that our dogs are really free here. In HK, our dogs couldn't enter many parks, but now in Taiwan, they can go almost anywhere. 

 

To our dogs, we're their family. We must take responsibility for them. When our dogs sense we're upset, they come to us. When we are upset, the dogs come to comfort us. So our dogs come and stay by our side, sometimes nudging us to comfort us. They can sense when we're quiet and upset, so they come closer to us.  
 
Even a normal life is impossible for us. Our names are already on 

the CCP's list of "rioters", and our faces were exposed after we were detained. 

No matter how we hide, we're still labelled as "rioters" who jeopardize PRC's national security. The PRC's national security will continue monitor us and restrict our freedom, so we simply have to keep moving forward.
